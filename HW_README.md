This homework asked students to create a googlebooks react app. 

We build out the app to search books and save books that were searched.

The search section allows users to find books with the Google Books API and render them here or save it. 

The save section allows user to have an option to see the book/books, bringing them to the book on Google Books.

The search criteria included Title, Author, Description, Image and Link. 

The title shows the title of a books. 

The authors shows who wrote the book.

The description describes the book.

The image shows the image of the book cover. 

Lastly the link attached allows the option for the user to buy the book through google.
